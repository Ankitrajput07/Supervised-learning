# ML Works 🚀

This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning projects** built to demonstrate
strong understanding of **Supervised Learning**, including both **Regression** and **Classification**
problems.  
Each project follows a **real-world ML workflow**: data understanding, EDA, preprocessing,
model building, evaluation, and insights.

The repository is organized cleanly by problem type for clarity and scalability.

## 🧠 Projects Overview

### 🔹 Supervised Classification
Projects where the target variable is **categorical (0/1)**.

- **Heart Disease Prediction**
  - Dataset: `heart.csv`
  - Goal: Predict whether a patient has heart disease
  - Techniques: EDA, feature encoding, scaling, Logistic Regression
  - Focus: Medical risk prediction and explainability

- **Social Network Ads Prediction**
  - Dataset: `social_network_ads.csv`
  - Goal: Predict whether a user will purchase a product
  - Techniques: Logistic Regression, decision boundary visualization
  - Focus: Marketing analytics and customer behavior

---

### 🔹 Supervised Regression
Projects where the target variable is **continuous numeric**.

- **Experience vs Salary Prediction**
  - Dataset: `Experience-Salary.csv`
  - Goal: Predict salary based on experience
  - Techniques: Linear Regression, EDA, model evaluation

- **Insurance Cost Prediction**
  - Dataset: `insurance.csv`
  - Goal: Predict medical insurance charges
  - Techniques: Polynomial Regression, feature engineering, scaling
  - Focus: Non-linear relationships and overfitting awareness

- **Netflix Movie Duration Analysis**
  - Dataset: `netflix_titles.csv`
  - Goal: Predict movie duration (in minutes) using metadata
  - Techniques: Data cleaning, encoding, regression modeling
  - Focus: Real-world data preprocessing and feature selection
